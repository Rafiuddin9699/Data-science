    "\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that operate on the data into a single unit, called a class. It helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only exposes the necessary functionalities to interact with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Abstraction: Abstraction is the concept of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details while showing only the essential features of an object. It allows us to focus on what an object does without needing to know how it achieves it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reusability and helps in creating a hierarchy of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their superclass. It enables a single interface to represent multiple types. Polymorphism is achieved through method overriding (redefining a method in a subclass) and method overloading (defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters)."
