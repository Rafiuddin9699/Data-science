    "'''Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the differen,e etween Exceptions and syntx errors?\n",
    "A1. An exception in Python is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional condition arises, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by the program to prevent termination or to perform alternative actions.\n",
    "\n",
    " The difference between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when something unexpected happens, such as division by zero, file not found, invalid input, etc. They disrupt the normal flow of the program. Examples of exceptions include ZeroDivisionError, FileNotFoundError, ValueError, etc. Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors, also known as parsing errors, occur when the syntax of the code is incorrect. They occur during the parsing of code before the program is executed. Syntax errors indicate that there is a mistake in the syntax of the code, such as missing parentheses, missing colons, incorrect indentation, etc. Syntax errors prevent the program from being executed. Examples of syntax errors include SyntaxError, IndentationError, NameError (in some cases, when a variable or function is not defined), etc.''''\n"
